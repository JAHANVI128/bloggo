# About
Written in Go, Bloggo is an open source static site generator available under the [MIT License](https://github.com/itsksrof/bloggo/blob/master/LICENSE.md). Bloggo supports YAML, TOML and JSON data types for front matter, and Markdown and HTML for content files. Other notable feature is the support for custom themes.

Bloggo makes use of a variety of open source projects including:
- [github.com/yuin/goldmark](github.com/yuin/goldmark)
- [github.com/adrg/frontmatter](github.com/adrg/frontmatter)
- [github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2](github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2)

Bloggo is for people who want a simplistic static site generator that prioritizes content over features, and who want a solution that works out-of-the-box.

Websites built with Bloggo are extremly fast *because it's just plain html*, secure and can be deployed anywhere including,
Github Pages, Netlify, Heroku and any other hosting provider.
